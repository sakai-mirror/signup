<h2>Sign-up Tool: Meeting Types</h2>

<p>There are three types of events or meetings:</p>

<ul type="disc">
<li>
<p><strong>Open meeting:</strong>creates a single timeslot for an event or
meeting, serving as an announcement. &nbsp;No attendance list is kept,
so participants who plan to attend are not required to sign up.</P>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Single slot:</strong>a single timeslot is created, an
attendance list is maintained, and the number of participants can be limited or 
unlimited. Participants are required to sign up in order to appear on the attendance list.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p><strong>Multiple slots:</strong>a single time span can be divided into
any number of timeslots of equal length, under a single meeting name.
For example, a two hour meeting could have
four half-hour slots, three 40-minute slots, or eight quarter-hour
slots. &nbsp;The timeslots can also be defined at irregular times over
different days.&nbsp; For each slot a maximum number of participants is
specified. Participants are required to sign up in order to appear on
the attendance list.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The resulting series of timeslots can be
removed or modified individually.&nbsp; (This option does not
automatically set up a recurring meeting.)</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Note:</strong>All these meeting types can be set up as
recurring events, which creates several different meetings under the
same title according to a given schedule. &nbsp;See &#8220;Creating meetings,&#8221; 
and the &#8220;Meeting frequency&#8221; setting.</p>
