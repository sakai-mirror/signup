Sign-up tool: Student or participant process
</h2>

<p>
If your instructor is using the Sign-up tool you will see it listed on the left side of the page.
</p>

<ol start="1" type="1">
<li>
<p>Click <strong>Sign-up</strong> and from the View drop-down menu, you can choose "view meetings 
I am signed up for" or "meetings available for sign-up."&nbsp; The latter view will also show 
those that you have signed up for already.</p>

</li>
<li><p>Follow the directions to sign up for a meeting using the button
labelled &#8220;Sign-up&#8221; beside the timeslot you want. If a &#8220;Meeting
Status&#8221; message shows that the meeting is not yet open to sign-up, note
the beginning sign-up time shown.&nbsp; If the meeting is full and
your instructor has given the Wati List option, you will be able to add your
name to the Wait List to be, if space becomes available, added to the
list of attendees, and notified by email.</p>

<p><strong>Notes:</strong>&nbsp; If your instructor has allowed, you will
see a comment field where you can type a message, which is seen only by
the instructor.&nbsp; If a lock icon appears in Meeting Details next to a timeslot, 
your instructor has removed that timeslot from further sign-up.</p>
</li>
<li><p>You may cancel any appointment you have signed up for, within the
time period allowed by your instructor, by clicking the Meeting Title,
then <strong>Cancel Sign-up</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At the instructor's discretion, you may be able to see the names of participants who have signed 

up.</p>
