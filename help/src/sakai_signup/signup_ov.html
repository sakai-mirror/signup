<h2>Sign-up tool : Overview</h2>
<p>Creation of the Sign-up tool was motivated by requests from 
faculty who wanted
   to replace the 'sign up sheets on the door' with an online 
alternative. Faculty
   needed a system that would   allow students to sign up for office hours,
   meetings, review sessions and other events in one convenient place. This tool
   can also be used in project sites to create meetings for the 
participants.</p>
<p>If a time slot is full, participants can add themselves
   to a wait list.  The tool automatically &quot;promotes&quot; a participant
   when a slot becomes available and sends an email notification. </p>
<h3>Adding the the Sign-up tool to a site </h3>

<p>Click <strong>Site Info</strong>, then <strong>Edit Tools</strong> and check
   the box next to &quot;Sign-up.&quot; Then click 
<strong>Continue</strong> and <strong>Finish</strong>.
   You'll see the tool listed on the left side of the page. </p>

<h3><strong>Who can use the tool?</strong></h3>
<p>In course sites, the instructor and TF have permission to create meetings
   and students are allowed to sign up for them. Instructors and TFs can permit
   students in any of the courses they teach to sign up for a meeting. </p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> if you would like to grant permission to 
students to create meetings,
   please email <a 
href="mailto:sakaiAdmin@yourInstitution.edu">Sakai Admin</a> and we will set 
the permissions for your site. </p>
<p>In Project sites, the Maintainer can create meetings and everyone
   can sign up for them. </p>
