<h2>Sign-up tool:&nbsp; Participation, permissions and display</h2>

<p>
<strong>Views</strong>:&nbsp; Different views may be chosen in the
drop-down list on the Meetings page, showing meetings over different
time spans, meetings for which the user has already signed up, or meetings available for sign-up.&nbsp;
Recurring meetings are shown in the list with a plus sign adjacent to
the name, which may be clicked to open the list and show the recurrences.&nbsp;
All are shown thus if the &#8220;Expand all recurring meetings&#8221; box is
checked.
</p>

<p>The Meetings table, by default, shows the list of meetings by
ascending date and time.&nbsp; The table may be re-ordered by clicking
on a column heading for the item of interest. &nbsp;Clicking on &#8220;Meeting Title,&#8221;
for instance, shows the list in alphabetical order, with all meetings
of the same title, on different dates and times, grouped together.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Viewing and adding participants</strong>: &nbsp;In addition to
the voluntary sign-up action taken by participants, a meeting organizer
may add participants manually.&nbsp; To do so, click the
&#8220;Add Participants&#8221; link and select names or groups from the drop-down
list.&nbsp; If you are the Organizer (that is, you created the
meeting), you cannot add yourself to the list; other participants will
see your name listed as &#8220;Organizer&#8221; in the Meeting Details.
</p>

<p>To see the list of participants who have signed up for a meeting,
click its title to reveal the Meeting Details.&nbsp; Names of those
signed up will appear in the Participants column of the timeslots table, adjacent to
the time slots they chose.&nbsp; A red &#8220;delete&#8221; button and a
pencil-and-pad &#8220;edit&#8221; button, which allows that participant to be
replaced with another, appears next to each name.&nbsp; The appearance
of a small blue bubble icon to the right of the name means that the
participant has added a comment at the time of sign-up, which can be
seen by clicking on that icon.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Permissions</strong>:&nbsp; The set of permissions applies to
the use of the Sign-up Tool across the site, not to any particular
meeting. &nbsp;Permissions can be granted,
by role,, with an interface for doing so that resembles that of other
tools.&nbsp; The &#8220;Permissions&#8221; link shows, &nbsp;for each realm of
grouping&#8212; (1) <em>site</em> (all members), and (2, 3, ...) <em>group</em>,
for each group defined on that site, a labelled button that leads to
an authorization matrix.&nbsp; For groups that do not include the site
organizer as a member, the group button is not active in the
Permissions settings and the site organizer cannot adjust the settings.&nbsp;
</p>

<p>Only certain permissions in certain contexts are meaningful.&nbsp;
The privilege &#8220;create.site&#8221; addresses creation of new meetings, so, if
that box is checked in the &#8220;access&#8221; row, representing users with
student status, students will have the &#8220;Add&#8221; link on their
Meetings page.&nbsp; If &#8220;create.site&#8221; is not checked for the access
role, but &#8220;create.group&#8221; is checked in the
&#8220;access&#8221; row for a site group (defined in Site Info), then student
members of that group will have the &#8220;Add&#8221; link, and be able
to create meetings, for that group only.&nbsp; If groups are defined,
the &#8220;view&#8221; and &#8220;attend&#8221; permissions must be checked for
that group realm, as stated on screen, in order for group members to
sign up.&nbsp; No adjustment will allow the Sign-up button to appear
for meeting organizers.&nbsp; For more details, contact your system administrator.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Listing on the Schedule or Calendar tool</strong>
:&nbsp; If you create a meeting without the Schedule tool on the
site, but add the Schedule tool later, you can add each meeting
individually to the Schedule&#8217;s calendar:&nbsp; In the Sign-Up tool, click on the
meeting name, click the &#8220;Modify&#8221; option at the top, then find and click
on the option &#8220;Show other default settings.&#8221;&nbsp; That
will allow you to choose to publish the meeting to the Schedule.&nbsp;
Repeat for all other meetings that you want on the Schedule.
