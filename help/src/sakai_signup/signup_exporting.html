<h2>Sign-up tool:&nbsp; Exporting meeting data</h2>

<p>To download meeting data:</p>

<p>The &#8220;Export&#8221; operation provides a rich set of data, in spreadsheet
form, for a set of meetings or for a single meeting, including the list
of those who have signed up.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>For a single meeting:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;In the &#8220;Meeting Details&#8221; page, click 

on the &#8220;Export&#8221; link at the top of the page.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>For a set of meetings:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;Choose a view on the main 

&#8220;Meetings&#8221; page, click the &#8220;Export&#8221; link, select the meetings desired, and 

click &#8220;Export&#8221;at the top or bottom of the list.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The &#8220;.xls&#8221; file thereby created can be opened in Excel or some other spreadsheet 

application to show several sheets, as follows.</p>

<ul type="disc">
<li>
Attendees&#8217; Schedules [for meeting organizers]&#8212; a datasheet with columns that 
show the meeting&#8217;s details, with one row for each meeting attendee signed up.&nbsp;
</li>
<li>
Events Overview&#8212;a chart of all meetings selected as they appear in the Meetings page.
</li>
<li>
For each meeting, a named sheet--
<br>Chart showing the meeting title and details, plus a list of
attendees [for users with that privilege], the wait list, and comments.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
An individual can select &#8220;View All Meetings I Am Signed Up For&#8221; to see scheduled 

commitments on the screen, and then select
&#8220;Export&#8221; to save or print that list shown in the &#8220;Events Overview&#8221; sheet.
