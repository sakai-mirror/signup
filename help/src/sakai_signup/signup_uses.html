<h2>Sign-up tool: suggestions for use</h2>

<p>The Sign-up tool can be used in a variety of ways for teaching
arrangements.&nbsp; The list below explains some, but is by no means
exhaustive.
</p>

<OL>
<li>
<p>To hold an advance sign-up for
special office hours on a problem set, including students from two
different classes:&nbsp; Choose a day, define a block of time, set up multiple
slots available to both sites&#8217; members, and then adjust the timeslots
as desired.&nbsp; For example, suppose the instructor wants to schedule a
3-hour block of time for office hours with some 15-minute slots and
some 30-minute slots and a 15-minute gap for a break.&nbsp; Here is the
procedure:</p>

<OL type='a'>
<li>
<p>Set up a 3-hour meeting called
&#8220;Office Hours&#8212;Problem Set&#8221; with 15-minute timeslots according to the
&#8220;Multiple slots&#8221; instructions.&nbsp; In the &#8220;Available To&#8221; field, leave
the current site checked and open the &#8220;Other Sites&#8221; list to check the other 
class&#8217;s site (which must also have the Sign-up Tool), as well.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After publishing the meeting to get
the initial allocation of timeslots, click the meeting name, and then
click &#8216;Modify,&#8217; check the&nbsp; box next to &#8220;Advanced user-defined timeslots&#8221; and click &#8220;Edit Timeslots.&#8221;</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Adjust the timeslots as
needed.&nbsp; Edit the start and end times to change the time period to
30 minutes on some slots.&nbsp; Delete a 15-minute slot, to reserve a break time.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Invite the students of both classes to
sign up.&nbsp; The entry will appear to them under a single title
&#8220;Office Hours&#8212;Problem Set&#8221; with several timeslots specified by start and end times.</p>
</li>
</OL>
</li>

<li>
<p>To schedule in-class presentations either by individuals or groups:</p>

<ol type='a'>
<li>
<p>Recurring Method:&nbsp; Set up a
single-slot recurring meeting within the time of the class period.
&nbsp;This method is easy, but it produces several separate meetings and allows an
individual student to sign up for more than one presentation slot by mistake.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Multiple-slot Method:&nbsp; Create
one meeting using &#8220;Advanced user-defined timeslots,&#8221; specifying
additional new timeslots for each class period as needed. &nbsp;This method requires 
more manual entries, but produces only one meeting with several date options, preventing 
an individual student from signing up for more than one.</p>

<p>In each case, ask the students to indicate the topics of their
presentations by typing them in the comment area when they sign up.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>

<li>
<p>To get an estimate of how many
students would attend a review session, set up a meeting with no limit
on the number of participants who can sign up. This is useful in choosing a room of
adequate size for the session.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>To set up a two-day recurring
meeting, use the &#8220;Advanced timeslots&#8221; and &#8220;Meeting frequency&#8221;
options.&nbsp; For example, suppose a group of six pharmacy students on
professional rotations in the field are to return to campus for consultations
together on Friday afternoon and Saturday morning every other week,
from April until the end of July.&nbsp; In the Pharmacy site, the meeting organizer
sets it up according to this procedure:</p>

<ol type='a'>
<li>
<p>Add a new meeting, entitled
&#8220;Fri-Sat Campus Consult,&#8221; with the appropriate location and description</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Select the &#8220;Advanced user-defined
timeslots&#8221; and specify the first week&#8217;s timeslots, say, Friday
April 1<sup>st</sup>, 4:00 &#8211; 6:00 PM, and Saturday April 2<sup>nd</sup>, 
9:00 &#8211; 11:00 AM.&nbsp; The maximum enrollment value is irrelevant,
as participants will be added manually.&nbsp; Delete extra timeslots via the red X.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>For the meeting frequency, select &#8220;Biweekly&#8221; 
and specify an end date of Sunday July 31st.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Set the other parameters as appropriate for
the circumstances (display names, use e-mail notifications, no wait
lists, no comments, and so forth).
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Select the button &#8220;Assign
participants and publish&#8221; and select the participants for both timeslots, also
checking the box &#8220;Yes, assign participants to the same timeslot for all
occurrences.&#8221; &nbsp;In each resulting meeting, if desired, select
the timeslot and lock against further participant sign-up.&nbsp; (Note
that the creation of a site group of the intended six students would allow
association of the group by name, obviating this step.)
<br>
</p>
</li>

</ol>
<p>This creates a series of nine meetings under a single title, Fridays
and Saturdays on alternate weeks, with the same group of participants.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>To determine the best schedule for
a series of meetings with a group of participants&#8212;for example, student
tutorials-- define a weekly time by soliciting input from the
participants on several choices.&nbsp; Select the optimal choice, and copy that timeslot
across several weeks as a recurring meeting.&nbsp; When an exception
must be handled, adjust that particular meeting according to the &#8220;Editing a
meeting&#8221; instructions.&nbsp; Here is the detailed procedure:
</p>



<ol start="a" type="a">
<li><p>Using a representative week, such as the first week of the term,
create a new meeting for each possible timeslot across the various weekdays, and
ask the participants to sign up for <em>all</em> candidate meetings that they can 
attend on a weekly basis.&nbsp; You might name these meetings
&#8220;Tutorial Option Monday, 3-5&#8221;, Tutorial Option Thursday, 9-11,&#8221; 
and so forth.&nbsp; Select &#8220;single slot,&#8221; and
&#8220;unlimited participation&#8221; for these meetings.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When the sign-up period has ended (as you specified in the meeting
details), find the best choice for the regular timeslot, one that
includes all or most participants.&nbsp; Each meeting will have to be opened or
exported to see the list of participants who signed up.&nbsp; Click the chosen
candidate meeting and choose &#8220;Copy.&#8221;&nbsp; (See above.)&nbsp; The
&#8220;Meeting frequency&#8221; setting can be switched to Weekly,
and the &#8220;End After&#8221; date set to the end of the term, producing a
population of meetings across the desired duration.&nbsp; The rejected
candidate meetings can be deleted with &#8220;Remove.&#8221;</p>
</li>
<li><p>Any of the separate meetings generated by the multiple-slot
definition can be can be modified, if it becomes necessary:&nbsp; To
make the series visible, in the Meetings list, either expand it alone or select the
checkbox labelled &#8220;Expand all recurring meetings.&#8221;&nbsp; For the
meeting in question, click on &#8220;Modify,&#8221; and select &#8220;Modify current
only&#8221; at the top of the page, as you change the time or date.</p>
